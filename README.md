# NinjaView

NinjaView is a simple C++/Qt6 image viewer designed for rapid previewing of photos, specifically tailored for workflows involving SD cards and digital cameras. It features a classic aesthetic built on the [Kaakao](https://github.com/veskuh/Kaakao) component set.

## Features

- **Fast Previews**: Asynchronous image decoding with intelligent caching for smooth gallery browsing.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Double-click any image to enter a distraction-free viewing mode.
- **Desktop-First Navigation**: Full keyboard support (Arrow keys for cycling, Escape to exit) and touchpad scrolling.
- **Classic Look**: A faithful recreation of the classic Mac OS X interface using custom QML components.
- **Robust Core**: Written in modern C++17 and Qt6 for performance and stability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Qt 6.8.3+** (with Core, Gui, Qml, Quick, QuickControls2, Core5Compat, ShaderTools, Concurrent)
- **CMake 3.16+**
- **Compiler**: C++17 capable (Clang, GCC, MSVC)

### Build Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository with submodules**:
    ```bash
    git clone --recursive git@github.com:veskuh/NinjaView.git
    cd NinjaView
    ```

2.  **Configure and Build**:
    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build -j12
    ```

3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    # On macOS:
    open build/src/NinjaView.app
    
    # On Linux:
    ./build/src/ninjaview
    ```

## Development

### Testing

The project includes both C++ unit tests and QML UI tests.

```bash
# Run all tests
ctest --test-dir build/tests --output-on-failure

# Run a self-diagnostic check
./build/src/ninjaview --selftest
```

### Project Structure

- `src/core/`: Backend logic and image discovery.
- `src/ui/`: C++ ViewModels and Image Providers.
- `src/qml/`: High-performance UI components.
- `tests/`: Comprehensive test suite.
- `Kaakao/`: The UI component library submodule.

## Packaging

NinjaView supports native standalone packaging for macOS and Linux.

### macOS
To generate the pruned standalone macOS `.app` bundle, run:
```bash
cmake --install build --prefix install_dir
```
This runs `macdeployqt`, removes unnecessary libraries, and signs the resulting bundle.

### Linux (.deb & .rpm)
NinjaView packages utilize the system's package-managed Qt 6. To package the application on Linux using CPack, run:
```bash
# Generate DEB (Ubuntu/Debian) or RPM (Fedora) packages
cpack --config build/CPackConfig.cmake -G DEB
cpack --config build/CPackConfig.cmake -G RPM
```

## CI/CD

NinjaView uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration.
- **Pull Requests / Commits**: Automatically builds and runs the test suite on both **Ubuntu 24.04** and **macOS 14** runners.
- **Releases**: Tagging a commit (with `v*`) automatically builds and publishes the release packages:
  - Zipped macOS standalone application (`NinjaView.app.zip`).
  - Native Linux packages built inside **Ubuntu 26.04** (`.deb`) and **Fedora 42** (`.rpm`) Docker containers, dynamically linked against system Qt 6.
